1. Introduction
---------------
This guide is designed to assist developers in getting myExperiment up and running on their own server, including all the Ruby-on-Rails infrastructure.  Below is comprehensive instructions on how to install MyExperiment on a Debian/Ubuntu system.  It is mostly applicable to all Linux systems.  In the future we hope to add similar instructions for Windows systems.


2. Installing on Debian/Ubuntu
------------------------------

2.1 Installation System Specification
-------------------------------------
* Pentium D 2.8GHz
* 1GB RAM
* 250GB Hard Disk
* Debian Lenny (Linux Kernel 2.6.22-3-686 #1 SMP)
* Apache 2.2.8
* MySQL Version 14.12, Distribution 5.0.51a 
* Java version 1.5.0
  * gij (GNU libgcj) version 4.3.1 20080309 (prerelease) 

2.2 Installation Instructions
-----------------------------
As Root user:

* Use Debian's package installer (i.e. apt-get install) to install the following packages: 
root> apt-get install make ruby libzlib-ruby rdoc irb rubygems

* Check to see which version of ruby has installed:
root> ruby --version
   * If this is < v1.86 you will need to compile from source using http://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/1.8/ruby-1.8.6-p286.tar.gz.

* Check to see which version of rubygems has installed:
root> gem -v
   * This needs to be version 0.9.4 or earlier or ruby-openid gem may not work and you will not be able to log into myExperiment on your server using OpenID.  The myExperiment team is currently working on a fix so that ruby-openid works on myExperiment with later versions of rubygems.

* Install Rails GEM version 1.2.6 
root> gem install rails --version=1.2.6

* Then install the following Debian packages: 
root> apt-get install libapache2-mod-fcgid libfcgi-ruby1.8 libmysql-ruby ruby1.8-dev build-essential

* MyExperiment requires the RMagick GEM. This can cause some problems on Debian.
   * To resolve this first make sure the following Debian packages are uninstalled: 
   root> apt-get remove --purge librmagick-ruby-doc librmagick-ruby1.8
   * Then install the following Debian packages: 
   root> apt-get install graphicsmagick imagemagick librmagick-ruby1.8 libmagick9-dev
 

* myExperiment also requires Graphviz because it has dot, which is required to draw workflow images:
root> apt-get install graphviz

* Now the rest of the GEMs required by MyExperiment can be installed: 
root> gem install builder cgi_multipart_eof_fix daemons dsl_accessor fastthread gem_plugin hoe json mime-types mongrel mongrel_cluster  
    needle net-sftp net-ssh openid_login_generator RedCloth ruby-yadis solr-ruby xml-simple rubyzip libxml-ruby oauth ruby-hmac --include-dependencies
    * During this process you may be requested to select one of a set of versions to install, choose the latest version suffixed with "(ruby)"
    * If you have problems install these gems all in one go, try installing them in smaller subsets or one at a time if needs be.
    * ruby-openid needs version 1.1.4 to work properly so that needs to be installed separately with the following command:
    root> gem install ruby-openid --version=1.1.4
    * rmagick needs version 1.15.7 to work properly so also needs to be installed separately with the following command:
    root> gem install rmagick --version=1.15.7

* OAuth was originally designed for Rails 2 and therefore some of the code in the GEM will not work in Rails 1.2.6.  To fixed this go to GEM_LIBRARY/oauth-0.2.4/lib/oauth/request_proxy/action_controller_request.rb and replace the contents of def request_params with:
    unless @request_parameters
      @request_parameters = request.request_parameters.dup
      request.symbolized_path_parameters.keys.each do |k|
        @request_parameters.delete k.to_s
      end if request.respond_to? :symbolized_path_parameters
    end
    @request_parameters

* Unfortunately, the Taverna GEM cannot be installed from a remote source, therefore it is included in the code-base which now needs to be downloaded.  The myExperiment code-base is stored within an SVN, so first SVN needs to be installed.
root> apt-get install subversion

* Now the system environment is ready for the MyExperimemt code base but first SVN needs to be installed so that the codebase can be downloaded. 
root> apt-get install subversion

* Before downloading the code base make sure that the terminal is in the correct directory. for this example the directory /var/rails/ will be used. 

* Now use the SVN to checkout the code base 
root> svn checkout svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/myexperiment

* To ensure that the downloaded file have the correct ownership run the following chown command over the downloaded SVN. (Where username is your username): 
root> chown -R username:www-data /var/rails/

* Now the Taverna GEM can be installed by using the following command from /trunk/vendor/gems/taverna/ directory:
root> gem install taverna-0.5.0.gem

* Now load up a mysql shell and create three databases as follows: 
mysql> create database m2_development;
mysql> create database m2_production;
mysql> create database m2_test;

* After exiting mysql switch user back to your username and change directory to /var/rails/myexperiment/trunk/config/ In the directory:
  * Copy database.yml.pre to database.yml.
  * Edit database.yml adding the appropriate passwords and usernames for the three databases.
  * Copy environment_private.rb.pre to environment_private.rb
  * Edit environment_private.rb. In particular to set the correct details for SMTP to allow emails to be sent by MyExperiment. Also make sure SOLR_ENABLE is set to true so that data in your MyExperiment can be indexed and searched over by users. 
  * Copy captcha.yml.pre to captcha.yml.
  * Edit captcha.yml to set it to the words you want to use in your captchas.

* Change directory back to /var/rails/myexperiment/trunk and run the following command as root:

root> apt-get install rake

* Now execute the following commands just as a user:
user> rake db:migrate
user> rake solr:start
user> ./resolr.sh

* '''./resolr.sh'''  may take some time to run (i.e. in the 5 minutes range) as it indexes the database to make searching quicker.  After this has run the webserver can be started with the following command:

user> ruby script/server

* This should start a mongrel webserver running on port 3000 of the installation system. To see if this has worked load up a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000
