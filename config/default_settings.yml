# site_name - Set "site_name" to the name of this myExperiment installation.
#             This is used by the myExperiment codebase to refer to service by
#             name.
#
#             Example:
#
#               site_name: mySite

site_name: mySite

# site_logo - set "site_logo" to the name of the logo used at the top left of
#             the web pages.

#                        contributors can contribute.

stylesheet: styles

# base_uri - Set "base_uri" to the main entry point to this installation of
#            myExperiment.  If you use a load balancing solution to proxy
#            incoming requests to a cluster, then this is the external address.
#
#            Examples:
#
#              base_uri: http://www.example.com
#
#            or

# main_tabs - These are the main tabs of the website.  Each entry requires at
#             least a label and a link.  If you specify a controller in a tab,
#             then the tab is shown as selected when the page has been served by
#             a controller that matches.
#
#             The controller entry is a regular expression, so you can make a tab
#             show as selected in multiple controllers.
#
#             Example:
#
#               main_tabs:
#
#                 - label:      Home
#                   link:       /home

# new_menu - Set "new_menu" with the details of each kind of thing to appear in
#            the New/Upload gadget.
#
#            Each entry must have at least a label and link.  You may specify
#            controller, in which case it is intepreted as a pattern against
#            that is matched with the current controller in use.  If it
#            matches, it becomes the pre selected option in the new/upload
#            combo box.
#
#            You may also specify a condition which is eval'd to determine if
#            the item should be included.
#
#            Example:
#
#              new_menu:

# =========== Settings for Activity Limits ===========

# Each limited feature will require a set of 5 settings; meanings of each
# described below.  First part of every setting is the name of the feature
# being limited.
#
# start_value - The initial maximum allowance for the feature (used when the
#               new limit is created)  
#
# max_value - Absolute maximum allowance for the feature (this can't be
#             exceeded after any promotions); 'null' for always increasing
#             allowance
#
# frequency (in hours) - The time period over which the allowance is given; for
#                        example 5 messages (allowance) for 24 hours
#                        (frequency) 'null' for non-periodic limits (i.e. limits
#                        which won't have their counters reset every
#                        <frequency> hours)
#
# promote_every (in days) -  Every <X> days the user will be promoted to the
#                            new level, where the allowance per frequency
#                            period will be adjusted by promote_increment;
#                            'null' to indicate that promotion should never
#                            happen
#
# promote_increment - Should be positive; 0 to indicate that promotion
#                     shouldn't expand the allowance (why would this be
#                     useful?) 'null' to perform a one-time promotion by setting
#                     the limit to whatever the value of max_value is; 'null'
#                     when the max_value is also 'null' makes the feature
#                     unlimited.
