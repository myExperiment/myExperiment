module Authorization

  # Authorisation check for instances and classes of objects.
  #
  # Arguments:
  #
  # action      - This string describes the action to be performed, e.g.
  #               'create', 'read', 'update' or 'destroy'.
  #
  # object      - This is the object being acted upon, e.g. an instance of a
  #               Comment or an instance of a Workflow.
  #
  # user        - The user that the check is with respect to.  Typically,
  #               this would be current_user.
  #
  # context     - This is the context in which the object or object to be
  #               created is made.  For example, pack entries can only be
  #               created by those that can edit the pack that the entry will
  #               be made in, so the context here would be an instance of the
  #               pack in question.  This is only usually required for 'create'
  #               actions.
