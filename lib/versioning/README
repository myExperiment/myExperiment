Versioning
==========

This plugin provides a simple versioning mechanism for Active Record.  Two
models are required: The model to be versioned and a model that contains the
versioned data for each version.


Example
=======

This example requires the following tables.  A Record model which contains a
title, description and some content.


  create_table "records" do |t|
    t.string   "title"
    t.text     "description"
    t.binary   "content"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.integer  "current_version"
  end

  create_table "record_versions" do |t|
    t.string   "title"
    t.text     "description"
    t.binary   "content"
    t.datetime "created_at"
    t.datetime "updated_at"
    t.integer  "version"
  end


In the following model code, we're stating that the "title", "description" and
"content" attributes are to be versioned.  In addition, the "title" and
"description" attributes may be changed in a specific version.


  class Record < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_versions :record_versions,
        :attributes => [ :title, :description, :content ],
        :mutable    => [ :title, :description ]
  end

  class RecordVersion < ActiveRecord::Base
    is_version_of :record
  end


Since "content" is the only attribute that cannot be changed in the
RecordVersion class, saving a record with different content will cause a new
version to be created.  If only the title or the description changes, then the
current version is updated to reflect those new changes.
